This allows us to reach a large audience of users and gives us the freedom to choose the devices we support, from personal computers to cell phones. The share of mobile traffic in 2023 is more than 65% of Internet users, which means support for mobile devices is a priority.</p><p class="item-content">Many Internet resources are attacked by cybercriminals. It is important not only to protect yourself from such incidents, but also to take care of stable operation. In addition to this mistakes in development, excessive overload and lack of up-to-date changes can have a negative impact on reliability, so I choose only proven platforms to host client sites, conduct all the necessary tests and maintain my projects.</p><p class="item-content">About 40% of visitors close the site without waiting for it to load if it takes more than 4-5 seconds. Also, search engines do not like slow sites, and this directly affects the position in search results, so I pay due attention to the speed of loading and operation of pages, responsiveness of the interface, which helps keep users on the site and does not cause discomfort when using the web application.</p><p class="item-content">Brand recognition is not the last thing visitors pay attention to. Contextual advertising, all sorts of promotion methods, incentives to take action and so on are usually used to attract potential customers. But why is it not always effective? What's most relevant to new users is how you differentiate yourself from your competitors, and the visual component will help attract attention and remember the brand.</p></div></div></div><div class="page-4"><p>If you want to use one of the digital product development and design services for you or your business, you are looking for a web developer, or you just liked my projects and would like to share your opinion about them â€” contact me by any in a way convenient for you.</p><?php echo $button ?></div></div></div>
